# vnerv
Tiny library for event broadcasting

I started this library as a fork of nice micro framework called Nerve - https://github.com/jstandish/nerve. 
I decided to create a separate repository because of a fundamental change - drop support for changing scope of the subscription function. Another difference is that vnerv is ES5 compliant and it has Gulp based build system.

It's a WIP repo.
